EasyTAG is a utility for viewing and editing tags for MP3, MP2, FLAC, Ogg
Vorbis, Speex and Opus, MP4/AAC, MusePack, Monkey's Audio and WavPack files.

### Compilation instructions

See INSTALL.

When running, if you get the following warning about the EasyTAG settings
schema that is not installed:

(easytag:19122): GLib-GIO-ERROR **: Settings schema 'org.gnome.EasyTAG' is not installed

make sure that the GSettings schema and enums files can be found somewhere in
$XDG_DATA_DIRS/glib-2.0/schemas (for example /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas) and
that the schema cache has been updated with glib-compile-schemas.

There are two files to copy to the schema path, and the glib-compile-schemas
command must run on the directories which have been updated. Example commands
follow:

sudo cp org.gnome.EasyTAG.enums.xml /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas
sudo cp data/org.gnome.EasyTAG.gschema.xml /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas
sudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/

If uninstalling, the files should be removed and the schema cache updated.
